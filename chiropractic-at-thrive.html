              <p>Use the simple, quick and convenient online booking tool to find a time that suits you and your schedule.

              <h4>First Appointment</h4>
              <p>We’ll chat through your health history, concerns, and goals to get a clear picture of where you're at. A full exam follows, checking posture, alignment, and nervous system function to fully understand what’s going on beneath the surface.

              <h4>Care That Evolves</h4>
              <p>As your body adapts, so will your care. Some appointments require more adjustments, some less. The adjustments given at each appointment are based on how you're progressing ensuring your care stays effective, responsive, and in tune with what your body needs.</p>

                      <p>
                        Over the years, I’ve invested deeply in the training and experience needed to care for the people I’m most passionate about: mums, mums-to-be, babies, and growing families. I’m fully certified in the Webster Technique, a gentle and specific approach used during pregnancy, and have completed my advanced certification with the International Chiropractic Paediatric Association (ICPA). I’m also proudly registered with the Pelvic Partnership, the United Chiropractic Association, and the General Chiropractic Council. Every qualification reflects my commitment to delivering safe, informed, and specialised care, because your family deserves nothing less.

                      <p>
                        Beyond the adjustments, this is a space for connection and honest care. While chiropractic can support many people, it’s not the right fit for everyone or for every concern. Part of my responsibility is knowing when to refer you on, and I take that seriously. I’ve spent years building a trusted local network of midwives, doulas, nutritionists, personal trainers, and other professionals. If what you need falls outside my scope, I’ll make sure you’re pointed in the right direction, with someone I know and trust. Because true care means doing what’s best for you.

                    Jess is amazing! Cannot recommend her enough, I've taken my whole family to see her for the past 3 years. My sons like her gentle technique and we appreciate that Jess takes the time to explain everything and provides exercises and recommends supplement changes to compliment our chiropractic care.

                    Jess is absolutely amazing. She is so knowledgeable and knew exactly how to help me. After just a few visits, I already felt so much better. The place that Jess has created at Thrive is also amazing. It’s comfy, welcoming and you feel relaxed as soon as you enter the door. I can’t recommend Jess highly enough.

                    Jessica is a caring, knowledgeable and gentle chiropractor. Her examinations are incredibly thorough and she really listens to you. I've experienced Chiropractic care with her before, during and after pregnancy. She assessed and adjusted my newborn which was incredible. I'd highly recommend her to everyone but especially women who want to experience a comfortable pregnancy and birth as well as those who want to get their children off to a good start in life. Jess, you are just wonderful, thank you for everything.

                    Jess is absolutely phenomenal. I can't praise her enough. When I came to her I was in pain in so many places, which I thought was just something I had to accept as part of ageing. When I asked Jess what she could do to help, she said she could eliminate the pain. I was incredulous, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and I am so delighted that I did. Because she worked through all my issues and I feel better now in my 50s that I ever did in my 40s. She is so intuitive and skilful she is able to find the sources of the issue and work through them. I would recommend her highly!

                    Jess has been my chiropractor for 16 years. I cannot recommend her enough. She is professional, thorough and really understands me as a client. I have scoliosis and my visits for adjustments keep me strong and as such have helped me to run 3 marathons and an ultra marathon and helped me to deal with some major life traumas. Without Jess's Chiropractic care these events would have been a lot harder to get through. Jess takes an holistic approach and general health and wellbeing are important to her.
                    The care I receive from Jess has definitely made a real difference to me.

                    I have been seeing Jess for a few years now and have recommended her to friends and family. I had never visited a chiropractor before but Jess explains everything she is doing, gives great advice on self care and creates a calm and friendly environment for treatment.

                    Jess is amazing! Feel so lucky to have found her. When I first went to see her, I was barely able to walk and facing my final few months of pregnancy using crutches. But she has literally helped me survive my third trimester giving me my mobility back and allowing me to be a much better version of myself. Her approach is kind, caring, professional and completely holistic - she really looks at the whole picture to make sure she can help as much as possible. Thank you Jess!

                        <p>I use gentle techniques tailored to your age, body, and needs—including feather-light pressure for babies (about the same as checking a tomato’s ripeness). Most people feel great afterwards—looser, lighter, or more balanced. Occasionally, you might feel a little tired or achy, which is a normal sign that your body is starting to respond. Staying active and hydrated after your adjustment can really help your body get the most from your care.</p>

With a thorough Initial Consultation and years of experience, I know what your body needs each session. Adjustments are precise and efficient, so they don't take long, a win win!  During an adjustment you might hear a popping sound, which is simply gas releasing from the joint—it’s normal and not painful and actually feels really good! I’ll always explain what to expect and how the adjustment will feel before we begin, so you can feel relaxed and informed every step of the way.</p>

                        <p>Chiropractic care for children is incredibly gentle and specifically adapted to suit their stage of development.

                        <p>I’ve worked hard to keep care affordable for individuals and families. You can choose to pay as you go for your adjustments or pay for care plans (12, 24 and 48 visits) in which can also be shared with your family. You can pay via the online booking portal, through the app (once you're an existing patient), or in person by card or cash. Most health insurance providers cover chiropractic care, though I have chosen not to register with BUPA or AXA PPP. For all other insurers, you pay up front and I’ll provide invoices for you to claim back. You’ll be able to see individual treatment prices on the booking portal. Care plan pricing is discussed during your second visit, once we’ve had a chance to understand your needs.</p>
